Anyway something I'm just realizing now is that the A/B sides are two 'versions' of the Langlands duality? What I learned is that the Higgs bundle is a principal G bundle over a curve C together with a section called the Higgs field and the Hitchin fibration makes the Higgs moduli of such bundles (where we vary the section) an integrable system? I'm not sure but I gather that the Hecke correspondence is supposed to relate Langlands dual Hitchin systems?

The Hecke correspondence is supposed to be the Higgs moduli of Higgs bundles (sounds a lot like the moduli description of Gr (and BD Gr) but I know Gr as 'the Coulomb' side of the picture. So is it true that...
