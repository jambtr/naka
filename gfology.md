# Generating function or local approximation

Let $k$ be the default base field (where the coefficients live).

A series $\{a_n\}$ can be assembled into a generating function $\sum_n a_n t^n$.

A series $\sum_n a_n t^n$ in $k[[t]]$ defines a function $f(x)$ with the property that $\hat f(n) = a_n$.

<!-- Recall the poisson summation formula says that $\sum f(n) = \sum \hat f(n)$. -->

And so for example the zeta function $\sum (n^{-1})^s$ is at once a function and a generating function.
